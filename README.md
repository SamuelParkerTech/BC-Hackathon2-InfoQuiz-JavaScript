## About

**Aeryx, Tanika, Samuel, Hackathon 2: JavaScript Quiz. July 2024**

**Team Name: Code Titans**

Designing a fully interactive quiz website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Board
Github Project Board: https://github.com/users/SubjugatorofCSS/projects/1/views/1

## Live Repo

## Wireframes 

Reponsive Wireframes - Website design skeleton to be responsive on all sites.

## Features

Main site page is the key page, there should be any other pages as all navigation should be done through the game. The page changes slightly with each question. \
Design elements:
Answer cards are created via Bootstrap cards (in future design we would have these flip over once selected with the result of the answers/correct/incorrect. Instead currently we have a pop up created. A score is added if the correct answer is provided and you receive a bad luck message if you are wrong. 

Colour Schemes:
#3F88C5\
#0AFFCE\
#FFFFE8\
#DDA448\
#F25083

Footer - Social links and team details featured at the bottom of the page. Visible on all pages.?

## Future Features
Interactive/animations for the results answers - cards transition/flip around. \
API Instead of manually created questions. We started with an API but we could not quite get it to work in the timeframe, so we made a decision to simplify to get a MVP out in the timeframe. 

## Testing
JavaScript testing - Correct Answer =/= correct/incorrect - does this work?\
Is the score calculated correctly?\
Are there any page errors?\
Is it responsive on all pages? 

## Validator Testing
HTML - \
CSS - \
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
