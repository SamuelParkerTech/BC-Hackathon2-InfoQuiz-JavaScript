## Features

Main site page is the key page, there should be any other pages as all navigation should be done through the game. The page changes slightly with each question. 
Design elements:
Answer cards are created via Bootstrap cards (in future design we would have these flip over once selected with the result of the answers/correct/incorrect. Instead currently we have a pop up created. A score is added if the correct answer is provided and you receive a bad luck message if you are wrong. 

Colour Schemes:

Footer - Social links and team details featured at the bottom of the page. Visible on all pages.?

## Future Features
Interactive/animations for the results answers - cards transition/flip around. 

## Testing
JavaScript testing - Correct Answer =/= correct/incorrect - does this work?
Is the score calculated correctly?
Are there any page errors?
Is it responsive on all pages? 

## Validator Testing
HTML - 
CSS - 
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
