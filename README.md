Main site page is the key page, there should not be any other pages as all navigation should be done through the game. The page changes slightly with each question. \
Design elements:
Answer cards are created via Bootstrap cards (in future design we would have these flip over once selected with the result of the answers/correct/incorrect. Instead currently we have a pop up created. A score is added if the correct answer is provided and you receive a bad luck message if you are wrong. 

Colour Schemes:
#3F88C5\
#0AFFCE\
#FFFFE8\
#DDA448\
#F25083

Footer - Social links and team details featured at the bottom of the page. Visible on all pages.?

## Future Features
Interactive/animations for the results answers - cards transition/flip around. \
API Instead of manually created questions. We started with an API but we could not quite get it to work in the timeframe, so we made a decision to simplify to get a MVP out in the timeframe. \
Modal pop ups instead of alerts would be a function I would like to add. 

## Testing
JavaScript testing - Correct Answer =/= correct/incorrect - does this work? Questions cycle through, however it currently does not submit or check answers. This is something we need to complete in the next steps. \
Is the score calculated correctly? Correct answers are not currently recorded so the score does not work either. \
Are there any page errors? No page errors \
Is it responsive on all pages? Very responsive on all pages.
